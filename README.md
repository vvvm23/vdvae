# Very Deep VAEs (VD-VAE) [Work in Progress]
PyTorch implementation of Very Deep VAE (VD-VAE).

Based off OpenAI implementation found [here](https://github.com/openai/vdvae) but removing clutter (paper visualizations, parallel compute, large datasets) to focus purely on the underlying architecture.

Original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10650).
